# Fabric REST Server
**Welcome to the REST Server for working with Hyperledger Fabric.**

> *tl;dr;*  
>Given a Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure, you give the rest server a Connection Profile of your organization's 'gateway' Peer; the rest server then stands up a OpenAPIv3 standard REST server allowing access all the way to the transaction functions of the smart contracts.
> Stand this up next to your 'gateway' peer with a conneciton profile and identity.

# Status
